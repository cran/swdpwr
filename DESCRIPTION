Description: To meet the needs of statistical power calculation for stepped wedge cluster randomized trials, we developed this software. Different parameters can be specified by users for different scenarios, including: cohort and cross-sectional settings, binary and continuous outcomes, marginal (GEE) and conditional (mixed effect model) methods,  different link functions (identity, log, logit links), with and without time effect of treatment, etc. The methods included in this package: Zhou et al. (2020) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxy031>, Li et al. (2018) <doi:10.1111/biom.12918>. Supplementary documents can be found at: <https://publichealth.yale.edu/cmips/research/software/swdpwr/>.
